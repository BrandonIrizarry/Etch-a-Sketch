I initially had "cell cell cell..." for my template areas, but that
unfortunately (for this case) merges them.

* Design Notes
** Features
+ Clicking should toggle whether the pen paints. Some of the projects
  paint regardless, which can lead to a slightly frustrating
  experience.

+ A lot of the projects have the person's Github account name, e.g., 

"Built and designed by Silinde87 | âš™"

But the gear is the Github icon, linking to that person's Github
profile.

+ A great many projects use sliders to determine the number of cells
  (instead of the prompt, say).

+ 100 x 100 might still be too intensive, maybe 60 x 60 is good.

+ Several implement a color picker, to select the pen's default
  painting color (letting alone a "psychedelic mode"). This should be
  "canon" for this project.

+ Most projects use a "clear" button to reset the canvas to a blank state.

+ An erase-button is a feature of some of the projects. A good summary
  of features might be:
  1. Pick the current color.

  2. Pick the current /background/ color. 

  3. A color /fill/, like the paint bucket in MS Paint. This sounds
     like an interesting technical challenge.

  4. A color /grabber/, like the eyedropper in Firefox. This would set
     the current foreground or background color. As a hard problem, we
     could store the current picked color somewhere, then when we pick
     a foreground or background color, we'll have the option of
     selecting this buffered color, in addition to the color picker.

  5. An eraser: reset the current cell's color to whatever the
     background color is.

  6. The rainbow/"psychedelic" feature. This is mainly because the
     project description itself suggests it.

  7. Shading/lightening. This looks like it has something to do with
     altering HSL values of the current color.

  8. A... slider? Not sure. Scaling doesn't necessarily copy the
     current image? If it did, a slider could be a good feature.

+ The buttons should really have a square dimension to them; and white
  should be the default background color. One project even rounds the
  corners of the cells slightly.

+ Also... some people's Githubs have README.md "splash" pages. 
* Checklist [6/14]
+ [X] Enable for mobile.
  - What should be the default behavior? Dragging with one's finger
    should be a mouseover. Perhaps the finger-tap-as-click works here
    still.
+ [X] The slider should now respond to swiping.
  - The slider that adjusts the grid size should also be touch-responsive.
+ [ ] Add some usage instructions in an aside div.
  - Do for both desktop and mobile. These would appear in an aside div.
+ [ ] Add a clear-all feature/button.
+ [ ] Maybe export to BMP?
+ [ ] For desktop, enable some keyboard shortcuts.
  - For example, left and right arrows can adjust the grid size.
+ [X] Be sure to add your tag at the bottom of the page.
+ [ ] Save the existing image when moving from smaller to larger dimensions?
  - When going the other way (larger to smaller), allow for
    truncation.
+ [ ] Dragging/swiping the slider widget towards the right becomes
  sluggish, especially on a (real) smartphone.
  - Could "debouncing" be the solution?
+ [ ] Add a color gradient going across the slider?
  - We would also have to change the color of the selected slider
    button, since the slider buttons on the left will start out black.
+ [X] For desktop: when pen is up or down, change mouse icon accordingly.
+ [X] Migrate from labels/input-checkboxes to simple divs, or possibly
  something like links or buttons. [[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-links-and-buttons-with-state-pseudo-classes-in-css][This Digital Ocean article]] looks
  promising.
+ [X] See [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/46988880][this link]] for my inspiration for integrating the color
  picker seamlessly with the radio element.
+ [ ] Using the application on desktop appears to be a bit
  confusing... will instructions be enough?
* Priorities <2023-01-04 Wed> [0/5]
  1. [ ] Add a "clear all" button.
  2. [ ] Design the slider to use a color gradient.
  3. [ ] Export to bmp/png.
  4. [ ] Save existing image when resizing.
  5. [ ] Usage instructions.

* Priorities <2023-01-06 Fri> [0/2]
  1. [ ] Slider: click and drag with the mouse, don't use mouseover
     - mouseover is too distracting when you want to do other things.
  2. [ ] Bug: Cursor icon toggles incorrectly on desktop 
     - Click and drag to draw cells, not mouseover "state".

* Priorities <2023-01-07 Sat> [5/5]
  1. [X] Rotation on a smartphone ruins the layout
  2. [X] Use Flexbox instead of Grid for the top-level layout
     - flex-direction of column for mobile, flex direction of row for
       wider screens.
  3. [X] Assign event listeners individually, don't use 'forEach'
  4. [X] Implement "random colors" feature
  5. [X] Change background of psychedelic button
