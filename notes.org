I initially had "cell cell cell..." for my template areas, but that
unfortunately (for this case) merges them.

* Design Notes
** Features
+ Clicking should toggle whether the pen paints. Some of the projects
  paint regardless, which can lead to a slightly frustrating
  experience.

+ A lot of the projects have the person's Github account name, e.g., 

"Built and designed by Silinde87 | âš™"

But the gear is the Github icon, linking to that person's Github
profile.

+ A great many projects use sliders to determine the number of cells
  (instead of the prompt, say).

+ 100 x 100 might still be too intensive, maybe 60 x 60 is good.

+ Several implement a color picker, to select the pen's default
  painting color (letting alone a "psychedelic mode"). This should be
  "canon" for this project.

+ Most projects use a "clear" button to reset the canvas to a blank state.

+ An erase-button is a feature of some of the projects. A good summary
  of features might be:
  1. Pick the current color.

  2. Pick the current /background/ color. 

  3. A color /fill/, like the paint bucket in MS Paint. This sounds
     like an interesting technical challenge.

  4. A color /grabber/, like the eyedropper in Firefox. This would set
     the current foreground or background color. As a hard problem, we
     could store the current picked color somewhere, then when we pick
     a foreground or background color, we'll have the option of
     selecting this buffered color, in addition to the color picker.

  5. An eraser: reset the current cell's color to whatever the
     background color is.

  6. The rainbow/"psychedelic" feature. This is mainly because the
     project description itself suggests it.

  7. Shading/lightening. This looks like it has something to do with
     altering HSL values of the current color.

  8. A... slider? Not sure. Scaling doesn't necessarily copy the
     current image? If it did, a slider could be a good feature.

+ The buttons should really have a square dimension to them; and white
  should be the default background color. One project even rounds the
  corners of the cells slightly.

+ Also... some people's Githubs have README.md "splash" pages.
